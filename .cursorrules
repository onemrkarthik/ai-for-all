# Cursor Rules — ai-for-all Kitchen Design Gallery

You are an AI coding assistant working on a Next.js 16 kitchen design gallery with AI-powered consultation.

---

## AI Behavior Directives (CRITICAL)

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Follow them for EVERY code generation task.**

### Before Writing ANY Code

```
□ Which feature does this belong to?
□ Will this import from another feature? → STOP, refactor first
□ Which layer? (interface/logic/data) → Never mix
□ Does lib/ or app/components/ already have this?
```

### REFUSE to Generate Code That:

**Architecture Violations (ERROR - blocks push):**

| Violation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Cross-feature import | `professionals/` importing from `photos/` |
| Cross-API import | `api/professionals/` importing from `api/photos/` |
| Layer violation | Component importing from `lib/db` |
| Generic file names | `utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `misc.ts` |
| Missing client directive | React hooks without `'use client'` |

**Code Quality Violations (WARNING - should fix):**

| Violation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Type violations | `any`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck` |
| Promise chains | `.then()` instead of `async/await` |
| Console.log | `console.log()` in production code |
| CommonJS require | `require('x')` instead of `import` |
| Raw fetch | `fetch('/api/...')` instead of `api` client |
| Hardcoded paths | `href="/photos"` instead of `nav` helpers |
| Hardcoded values | URLs, IPs, secrets (except: schema.org, unsplash, xmlns, w3.org, localhost, example.com) |

### Automated Standards Enforcement

All generated code MUST pass `npm run check:standards`. For detailed explanations of each standard with examples, see `docs/STANDARDS.md`.

This script runs automatically:
- **Pre-push hook**: Blocks push if standards fail
- **GitHub Actions**: CI fails if standards fail

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| `no-generic-names` | No `utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `misc.ts` | ERROR |
| `layer-violation` | `app/` cannot import from `lib/db` directly | ERROR |
| `no-cross-feature-imports` | Features cannot import from other features | ERROR |
| `no-cross-api-imports` | API routes cannot import from other API routes | ERROR |
| `missing-use-client` | Components using hooks need `'use client'` | ERROR |
| `type-safety` | No `any`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck` | WARNING |
| `use-async-await` | Use `async/await` not `.then()` chains | WARNING |
| `no-console-log` | Remove `console.log` from production code | WARNING |
| `no-require-imports` | Use ES imports, not CommonJS `require()` | WARNING |
| `use-api-client` | Use `api` client, not raw `fetch('/api/...')` | WARNING |
| `use-nav-helpers` | Use `nav` helpers, not hardcoded paths | WARNING |
| `no-hardcoded-values` | No hardcoded URLs/IPs/secrets (with exceptions) | WARNING |
| `missing-readme` | Feature folders must have README.md | WARNING |
| `readme-missing-section` | Feature READMEs need required sections | WARNING |

**Self-validation before finalizing code:**
```
ARCHITECTURE (ERROR - must fix):
□ Would this pass npm run check:standards?
□ Are there any layer violations?
□ Are there any cross-feature imports?
□ Does client component have 'use client' directive?

CODE QUALITY (WARNING - should fix):
□ Are all types properly defined (no any)?
□ Using async/await (not .then() chains)?
□ No console.log statements?
□ Using ES imports (not require())?
□ Using api client (not raw fetch)?
□ Using nav helpers (not hardcoded paths)?
□ Are all URLs in the allowed list or config?
```

### When User Requests Violating Code

1. **STOP** — Do not generate the violating code
2. **EXPLAIN** — Tell user which rule it violates
3. **PROPOSE** — Offer a compliant alternative
4. **CONFIRM** — Get user approval before proceeding

Example response:
```
"I can't create this because it would import from photos/ into professionals/, 
which violates feature isolation.

Instead, I'll:
1. Extract shared code to lib/services/photoUtils.ts
2. Have both features import from there

Should I proceed?"
```

### ALWAYS Do:

- ✅ Propose file location before writing
- ✅ Use existing patterns from codebase
- ✅ Generate TypeScript types for all data
- ✅ Use `api` client for internal API calls
- ✅ Use `nav` helpers for routing
- ✅ Extract shared code proactively
- ✅ **Generate tests for ALL code written** (see below)
- ✅ **Generate documentation for ALL features built** (see below)
- ✅ **Keep documentation and tests in sync** (see below)

---

## Test Generation Rule (CRITICAL)

**Every code generation task MUST include corresponding unit tests.**

### Test File Location

| Code Location | Test Location |
|---------------|---------------|
| `app/components/Foo.tsx` | `tests/app/components/Foo.test.tsx` |
| `lib/services/bar.ts` | `tests/lib/services/bar.test.ts` |
| `app/api/baz/route.ts` | `tests/app/api/baz.test.ts` |
| `lib/utils/qux.ts` | `tests/lib/utils/qux.test.ts` |

### What to Test

| Code Type | Test Coverage |
|-----------|---------------|
| Components | Renders, props, events, conditional rendering |
| Services | Business logic, transformations, errors |
| API Routes | Response format, status codes, validation |
| Utilities | All inputs/outputs, edge cases |

### Test Template

```typescript
/**
 * Unit Tests for [file path]
 */
import { thing } from '@/path/to/module';

jest.mock('@/lib/db', () => ({ ... }));  // Mock dependencies

describe('Thing', () => {
  it('handles normal input', () => { ... });
  it('handles edge cases', () => { ... });
  it('throws on invalid input', () => { ... });
});
```

### Checklist

```
□ Created/updated tests for code written?
□ Tests cover happy path AND error cases?
□ External dependencies mocked?
□ All tests pass? (npm test)
```

---

## Documentation Rule (CRITICAL)

**Every feature MUST include comprehensive documentation.**

### Required: Feature README.md

Every feature folder must have a README.md with these sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Responsibilities** | What this feature handles / doesn't handle |
| **Key Components** | Table of components with file and purpose |
| **Routes** | Table of routes (if applicable) |
| **Data Flow** | How data moves through the feature |
| **Usage Examples** | Code examples showing usage |

### README Template

```markdown
# Feature Name

Brief description.

## Responsibilities

**Handles:** List responsibilities
**Does NOT handle:** List delegations

## Key Components

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Name | `file.tsx` | What it does |

## Routes

| Route | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/path` | `page.tsx` | What it shows |

## Data Flow

Source → Processing → Output

## Usage Examples

\`\`\`typescript
// Example code
\`\`\`
```

### Documentation Checklist

```
□ Feature README.md created?
□ Responsibilities section defines scope?
□ Key Components table complete?
□ Routes documented?
□ Data flow included?
□ Usage examples provided?
□ Project README.md updated?
```

---

## Documentation & Test Sync Rule (CRITICAL)

**Every code change must include updates to related documentation and tests.**

### After Every Code Change, Check:

```
□ README.md — Project structure, commands, features
□ ARCHITECTURE.md — File structure, architecture diagrams
□ lib/api/config.ts — New API routes
□ lib/api/types.ts — New request/response types
□ lib/navigation/routes.ts — New navigation paths
□ tests/architecture.test.ts — New folders, import patterns
□ Feature README files — Feature-specific documentation
```

### What to Update When:

| Change Type | Update These |
|-------------|--------------|
| New API route | `lib/api/config.ts`, `lib/api/types.ts`, `lib/api/client.ts`, `README.md` |
| New feature folder | `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `tests/architecture.test.ts` |
| New component | `README.md` project structure |
| Rename/move file | All imports, all documentation references |
| New command/script | `README.md` Commands section, `package.json` |
| Schema change | `lib/db/schema.ts`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` |

### Example Workflow:

```
User: "Add a /api/payments endpoint"

AI Response:
1. ✅ Create app/api/payments/route.ts
2. ✅ Add to lib/api/config.ts
3. ✅ Add types to lib/api/types.ts  
4. ✅ Add api.payments to lib/api/client.ts
5. ✅ Update README.md project structure
6. ✅ Update ARCHITECTURE.md file structure
7. ✅ Create app/api/payments/README.md
```

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 with App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript
- SQLite (better-sqlite3)
- Google Gemini AI

---

## Team Standards (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Single Responsibility
Every file, function, component does ONE thing. If you say "and" describing it, split it up.

### 2. Three-Layer Architecture

```
INTERFACE  → app/, app/api/, app/components/
LOGIC      → lib/api/, lib/navigation/, lib/services/
DATA       → lib/db/, lib/services/ (query functions)
```

- UI components never touch database directly
- Data layer never contains business rules
- Use service layer between UI and database

### 3. Feature Isolation (CRITICAL)

**Features CANNOT import from other features. Ever.**

```
app/
├── professionals/     ❌ Cannot import from photos/, styles/, etc.
├── photos/            ❌ Cannot import from professionals/, styles/, etc.
├── styles/            ❌ Cannot import from professionals/, photos/, etc.
├── api/
│   ├── professionals/ ❌ Cannot import from api/photos/, api/contact/, etc.
│   ├── photos/        ❌ Cannot import from api/professionals/, etc.
│   └── contact/       ❌ Cannot import from api/professionals/, etc.
├── components/        ✅ SHARED - any feature can use these
└── lib/               ✅ SHARED - any feature can use these
```

**When two features need the same code:**
1. UI components → Extract to `app/components/`
2. Business logic → Extract to `lib/services/`
3. Utilities → Extract to `lib/`

**Never create direct feature-to-feature dependencies.**

### 4. Human Readable
Non-technical team members must understand file names and structure.

### 5. Shareable by Default
No hardcoded values. No hidden dependencies. Everything explicit.

└── ai.ts                     # Gemini integration
```

## Naming Conventions

Functions: verb + noun
- ✅ `createPhoto`, `validateContact`, `fetchProfessional`
- ❌ `handleClick`, `processData`, `doStuff`

Files: descriptive content
- ✅ `photoGallery.tsx`, `chatService.ts`
- ❌ `utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`

---

## Type-Safe Patterns (Always Use These)

### API Calls
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - use typed API client
import { api } from '@/lib/api';
const photo = await api.photos.get(123);
const feed = await api.feed.list({ offset: 0, limit: 20 });

// ❌ WRONG - raw fetch
fetch('/api/photos/123')
```

### Navigation
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - use typed navigation
import { nav } from '@/lib/navigation';
<Link href={nav.professionals.detail(5)} />
<Link href={nav.home.index({ photo: 123 })} />

// ❌ WRONG - hardcoded paths
<Link href="/professionals/5" />
<Link href="/?photo=123" />
```

---

## Component Rules

### Server Components (default)
- No `'use client'` directive
- Data fetching happens here
- No useState, useEffect, event handlers

### Client Components
- Must have `'use client'` at top
- For interactivity (clicks, forms, state)
- Most components in `app/components/` are client

## Code Generation Checklist

Before generating:
- [ ] What ONE thing does this code do?
- [ ] Which layer? (interface / logic / data)
- [ ] Which folder?
- [ ] Does `lib/` already have this?

While generating:
- [ ] One function = one job
- [ ] Use `api` client, not raw fetch
- [ ] Use `nav` helpers, not hardcoded paths
- [ ] Types for all data structures
- [ ] No mixing layers

After generating:
- [ ] File has single purpose
- [ ] Names are descriptive
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Would work if copied elsewhere

---

## Anti-Patterns — Never Do

| Bad | Fix |
|-----|-----|
| God file | Split into layers |
| `utils.ts` | Specific files: `dateFormat.ts` |
| Raw `fetch()` | Use `api` client |
| Hardcoded paths | Use `nav` helpers |
| UI with DB calls | Use service layer |
| `any` type | Define proper types |
| `.then()` chains | Use `async/await` |
| `console.log` | Use error handling or remove |
| `require()` | Use ES `import` |
| Hooks without `'use client'` | Add directive at top |
| **Feature imports feature** | Extract to `app/components/` or `lib/` |
| **API imports API** | Extract to `lib/services/` |

---

## Database

SQLite with WAL mode. Never query directly from components.

Tables: `photos`, `photo_attributes`, `professionals`, `photos_professionals`, `reviews`, `conversations`, `messages`

Schema: `lib/db/schema.ts`

---

## Environment

Required in `.env.local`:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Get key at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

---

## Commit Messages

```
[feature] verb: description

[photos] add: style filtering
[chat] fix: message ordering
[lib] refactor: extract validation
```

---

## When Uncertain

1. Ask—don't assume
2. Check `lib/` for existing utilities
3. Choose simpler solutions
4. Suggest refactors for violations

## AI Quick Reference

**Pre-generation checklist:**
```
ARCHITECTURE (ERROR):
□ Feature: _____________ Layer: [ ]interface [ ]logic [ ]data
□ Cross-feature import? → STOP
□ Cross-API import? → STOP  
□ UI importing db? → STOP
□ File name generic? → Rename
□ Client component without 'use client'? → Add directive

CODE QUALITY (WARNING):
□ Using any type? → Define proper interface
□ Using .then()? → Convert to async/await
□ Using console.log? → Remove or use logger
□ Using require()? → Convert to ES import

TESTS (REQUIRED):
□ Test file created? → tests/[mirror path].test.ts(x)
□ Happy path tested?
□ Error cases tested?
□ Dependencies mocked?

DOCUMENTATION (REQUIRED):
□ Feature README.md created/updated?
□ Responsibilities section complete?
□ Key Components table complete?
□ Usage examples included?
```

**Import rules:**
```
✅ ALLOWED                 ❌ BLOCKED
feature → app/components/  feature → feature
feature → lib/*            api/X → api/Y
api → lib/services/        UI → lib/db
```

**Shared code locations:**
```
UI components  → app/components/
Business logic → lib/services/
API helpers    → lib/api/
Types          → lib/types/ or [feature]/types.ts
```

**Response template for violations:**
```
"I can't generate this because [RULE VIOLATED].

Instead, I'll:
1. [COMPLIANT STEP 1]
2. [COMPLIANT STEP 2]

Should I proceed?"
```

**Post-Change Documentation Sync:**
```
□ README.md updated?
□ ARCHITECTURE.md updated?
□ API config/types updated?
□ Tests updated?
□ Stale references fixed?
```

**Standards Validation (REQUIRED):**
```
Before committing, verify code passes: npm run check:standards

Allowed URL patterns (won't trigger warnings):
- schema.org (JSON-LD structured data)
- unsplash.com / images.unsplash.com (image CDN)
- xmlns / w3.org (XML/SVG namespaces)
- example.com (placeholder URLs)
- localhost (development)
```
